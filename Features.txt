1-Advanced Authorization System:

Currently, WhatsApp groups offer basic admin controls, allowing them to add/remove members, edit group information, and restrict messaging for all members. While beneficial, it limits flexibility. As Product Manager, I propose an advanced authorization system with differentiated roles.

This system would introduce "Messaging Specialist" as a new role beyond admin. Messaging Specialists:
-Can send messages within the group in the situations that other members can't.
-Lack administrative powers like adding/removing members or editing group information.

2-Dual Account for Dual SIM Cards:

Millions of users rely on dual SIM technology, often separating business and personal communications. Unfortunately, WhatsApp currently limits each account to one unique phone number. This poses a challenge for dual SIM users, forcing them to juggle accounts or resort to unofficial workarounds.

As Product Manager, I propose implementing a Dual Account System within the official WhatsApp app. This feature would allow users to:
-Run two independent WhatsApp accounts: One linked to each SIM card, enabling clear separation of business and personal messages.
-Seamless switching: Effortlessly toggle between accounts within the app, ensuring contextually relevant communication.
-Enhanced privacy and control: Maintain distinct identities and manage contacts for each account independently.

Given the need to focus on one feature at a time, I would prioritize the "Advanced Authorization System" for the following reasons:

-Broader Impact: This feature benefits all WhatsApp users, enabling more nuanced communication within groups by creating a "Messaging Specialist" role. This empowers members to share expertise without full admin powers, benefiting diverse group dynamics.
-Feasibility and Timeliness: With a potentially lower technical complexity compared to the Dual Account System, it can be implemented sooner, delivering value to users faster.
-Phased Approach: The Advanced Authorization System lays the groundwork for future features, potentially including group message moderation or refined access control, building upon its initial value.
While the Dual Account System addresses a specific user need, the Advanced Authorization System's wider applicability, faster implementation, and potential for future expansion make it the more strategic choice for initial development.
